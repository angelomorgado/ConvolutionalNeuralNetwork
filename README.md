  - These notes were made by me in order to properly understand the concept of convolutional neural networks in a fast and simple way.
  - Notes inspired by this wonderfull tutorial by Victor Zhou that can be found in (https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/) and (https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-2/)
  - The notes were made in portuguese, but the code was made in english, (note: I'm planning on doing the notes in english)
